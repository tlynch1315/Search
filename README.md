1) We handled parsing command line options by using strcmp because there are many different options and the options are strings, so using a switch case would not work.

2) we walkd directories by testing if the given path is a directory, and if it is not then the error is displayed.  If it is a directory, the directory is then read using readdir and if there are multiple files then false is returned

3) we decided to print it or not based on the settings.  If the print setting is true, then it is printed.  If not, then it is not printed.
